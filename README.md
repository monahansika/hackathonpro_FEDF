# Course Scheduler (Mock)

A minimal React + Vite mock application for student course selection and scheduling.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\Sudhe\OneDrive\Desktop\projectfedf\course-scheduler'
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Credentials:
- Admin: `admin` / `admin`
- Students: `alice` / `pass`, `bob` / `pass`

Notes:
- This is a frontend-only demo using `localStorage` for mock students.
- Admin can approve registrations and grant/revoke access.
- Student dashboard shows schedule, registration, CGPA, attendance, marks and simple calculators.
